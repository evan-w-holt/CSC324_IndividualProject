### Edigaul Abugida Text Tool
A tool for transliterating from the English alphabet into the Edigaul abugida (a fictional writing system). I made a series of images to use as an Edigaul font last spring for a piece of software I intended to make that did this transliterating, and this seemed like a good opportunity to actually get around to making that software.

See the about page of the site for info on what Edigaul is and what an abugida is.
