### Edigaul Abugida Text Tool
A tool for transliterating from the English alphabet into the Edigaul abugida (a fictional writing system). I made a series of images to use as an Edigaul font last spring for a piece of software I intended to make that did this transliterating, and this seemed like a good opportunity to actually get around to making that software.

See the about page of the site for info on what Edigaul is and what an abugida is.

This Edigaul website demonstrates how I learned to use the model-view-controller design pattern that comes with Ruby on Rails to build a website with a frontend and backend. With this website, I also learned how to navigate Ruby on Rails' system of convention over configuration. But, beyond learning purely Ruby on Rails specific things, this website shows how I learned to use a database and connect the frontend and backend and how I got better at writing and using HTML and CSS.
